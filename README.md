# Docker Stack for Aquaponics based on RaspberryPi and Watson IoT Platform

The intent of this project is to provide a self-service environment for using my aquaponics system and keep tracking of measures collected by an Arduino Uno connected to the aquaponic system that I made using [Makeblock](http://www.makeblock.com) parts.
